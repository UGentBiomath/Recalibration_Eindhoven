# Automatic (Re)Calibration Of Water Resource Recovery Facility Models To Ensure Continuous Model Performance

This repository contains the implementation of the automatic recalibration method **ES-NEAT** for the Water Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF) of Eindhoven (The Netherlands). The approach is described in the scientific paper *"Automatic (Re)Calibration Of Water Resource Recovery Facility Models To Ensure Continuous Model Performance"*. This project is targeted at researchers interested in model calibration, NEAT algorithms, and water resource management.

## Overview
This project aims to enhance reproducibility and transparency in WRRF modeling by implementing **ES-NEAT** to automatically recalibrate model parameters, ensuring continuous model performance. The WRRF model and real data used in this project are based on the Eindhoven facility.

### Key Concepts
- **NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)**: A genetic algorithm for evolving neural networks.
- **Expert Systems**: Used to guide the recalibration process.
- **Calibration Methods**: Ensuring model outputs align with real-world data.

---

## Features
- Automatic adjustment of WRRF parameters.
- Visualization of results comparing simulation outputs to real-world data.
- Model reproducibility with included NEAT seed files.
- Python implementation with minimal dependencies.

---

## Installation
### Dependencies
To run this project, you will need the following:
- Python 3.12
- Numpy 1.26.4
- Pandas 2.2.2
- NEAT 0.92
- WEST 2022 (required for additional WRRF modeling functionality)

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url/automatic-recalibration-wrrf.git
   cd automatic-recalibration-wrrf
   ```
---

## Usage
### Tools
You can run the code using:
- **Spyder**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

### Steps to Run
1. Load the input data from the `input_Data` folder.
2. Execute the calibration script or notebook.
3. View the generated results including RMSE, parameter adjustments, and visual plots.

No special environment configurations are required.

## Input Data
The repository includes the necessary input data located in the `input_Data` folder. The data is provided in:
- **CSV files** for tabular inputs.
- **TXT files** for additional configuration details.

---

## Results
The code generates the following outputs:
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of effluent data compared to real-world measurements.
- Visual plots of effluent data.
- Final adjusted model parameters.
- Time taken for the simulation.
- Updated NEAT seed file for future recalibrations.

Example results are detailed in the accompanying paper.
